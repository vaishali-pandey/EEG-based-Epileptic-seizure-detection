A novel approach for detecting epileptic seizures is introduced, centred around Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). 
This technique involves the sequential application of SVD on a one-second-wide sliding window of EEG data, obtaining r singular values that effectively highlight sudden changes in the signals. 
The proposed algorithm is validated using EEG recordings from 500 individuals, each comprising 4097 data points. 
Preliminary results indicate a good level of sensitivity of the singular values to changes in EEG signals during epileptic seizures. 
This heightened sensitivity can be employed for the development of a more robust seizure detection system in comparison to existing techniques.
